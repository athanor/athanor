$this currently does not type check with conjure due to a bug in the conjure type checker.
$check that this was a solution:
$ solution start
$ letting a be {}
$ letting b be {}
$ letting c be {1}
$ solution end

letting s be mset ({{}},{{1}})
letting t be {{},{}}
find a,b,c : set of int(1..3)
such that {} subsetEq {}
such that a subsetEq {}
such that {} subsetEq a
such that |b| = |{}|


such that forAll i in s . forAll j in i . forAll k in j . k in c
such that |c| = 1

such that catchUndef(min({}), -1) = -1
such that catchUndef(max({}), -1) = -1
such that forAll i in t . catchUndef(min(i), -1) = -1 /\ catchUndef(max(i), -1) = -1
such that forAll i in s . forAll j in i . catchUndef(min(j), 0) = |j| /\ catchUndef(max(j), 0) = |j|

such that 0 = sum i in {} . 1
such that 0 = sum i in {} . (i*2)
