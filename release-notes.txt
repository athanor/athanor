Several scalability optimisations to quantifier:

Expressions  that use sequence indexing to quantify over adjacent pairs/tripples/n-tuples of elements from a sequence are optimised to use the substring quantifier.

The index member of the tuples yielded when quantifying over sequences are not updated if they are not used.

Random generation of values used in initial variable assignements and in neighbourhoods now make use of a resource limit, allowing for the instantiation of deeply nested types such as set of sequence of partition of set of ...

Usage info is better printed, separated into groups accessed with --help group_name.
