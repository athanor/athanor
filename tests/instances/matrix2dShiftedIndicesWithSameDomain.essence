$there used to be a problem with using the same domains in the indices and expressions as they were merged leading to the wrong matrix index.
$this has been fixed in most contexts.

$testing:numberIterations=0
letting d1 be domain int(-3..0)
letting d2 be domain int(3..5)
find m : matrix indexed by [d1,d2] of int(-3..5)
such that forAll i : d1 . forAll j : d2 .  m[i,j] = i + j
