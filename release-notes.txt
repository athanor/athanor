Strategies:
Defaults to a new Exploration search strategy "auto", aims to avoid worst case performance of the other supported explore strategies, using dynamic learning to switch between them.
Experimental new strategies:
added support for strategy late acceptance hill climbing [alpha], basic hill climbing is still preferred and is the default.
Added neighbourhood search strategy: "search for  first solution that is at least as good" [alpha], still not preferred over the default.


New supported constraints constraints:
subsetEq for multi sets (subsetEq for sets already supported),
strict subset for sets and multi sets,
equality for sets and multi sets,
function range and  function pre image.

New types:
Basic support for relations, relation projections stil to come.

Miscellaneous:
Better handling of subsetEq quantifiers by rewriting the expression to already well supported constraints.

Athanor supports new Conjure APIs for converting Essence to JSON, old APIs will be supported until new official Conjure release.
